### Getting Started with Scapy

#### 1. **Installation**

To install Scapy, you can use `pip`:

```bash
pip install scapy
```

#### 2. **Basic Usage**

Hereâ€™s a quick overview of some basic operations you can perform with Scapy:

**a. Importing Scapy**

First, import the necessary modules:

```python
from scapy.all import *
```

**b. Creating a Packet**

You can create a simple packet with Scapy. For example, creating an ICMP (ping) packet:

```python
packet = IP(dst="8.8.8.8")/ICMP()
```

**c. Sending a Packet**

You can send the packet over the network:

```python
send(packet)
```

**d. Receiving Packets**

To capture packets, use the `sniff()` function. This captures packets for a certain number of seconds:

```python
packets = sniff(timeout=10)
packets.summary()
```

**e. Analyzing Packets**

You can inspect packet details using Scapy's built-in methods:

```python
for pkt in packets:
    pkt.show()
```

#### 3. **Crafting More Complex Packets**

Scapy allows for detailed packet crafting. For example, creating a TCP SYN packet:

```python
syn_packet = IP(dst="example.com")/TCP(dport=80, flags="S")
```

#### 4. **Handling Packet Responses**

You can send packets and wait for responses:

```python
response = sr1(syn_packet)
response.show()
```

#### 5. **Filtering Packets**

Scapy supports filters to capture specific types of packets. For example, to capture only TCP packets:

```python
packets = sniff(filter="tcp", timeout=10)
```

#### 6. **Writing Scripts**

You can write scripts to automate packet analysis. For instance, to detect SYN flood attacks, you might write:


```python
from scapy.all import *

def detect_syn_flood(packet):
    if packet.haslayer(TCP) and packet[TCP].flags == 'S':
        print(f"SYN Packet Detected: {packet[IP].src}")

sniff(prn=detect_syn_flood, filter="tcp", timeout=60)
```
