# Different Types of Shells

## Communicate Through a Shell

The **shell** is a **command-line interpreter**. You can think of a shell as a translator between you and the computer system. Shells allow you to give commands to the computer and receive responses from it. When you enter a command into a shell, the shell executes many internal processes to interpret your command, send it to the **kernel**, and return your results.

## Types of Shells

The many different types of **Linux shells** include the following:

- **Bourne-Again Shell (bash)**
- **C Shell (csh)**
- **Korn Shell (ksh)**
- **Enhanced C Shell (tcsh)**
- **Z Shell (zsh)**

All Linux shells use common Linux commands, but they can differ in other features. For example, **ksh** and **bash** use the dollar sign (`$`) to indicate where users type in their commands. Other shells, such as **zsh**, use the percent sign (`%`) for this purpose.

### Bash

**Bash** is the default shell in most **Linux distributions**. It’s considered a user-friendly shell. You can use **bash** for basic Linux commands as well as larger projects.

**Bash** is also the most popular shell in the **cybersecurity profession**. You’ll use **bash** throughout this course as you learn and practice Linux commands.

## Key Takeaways

- **Shells** are a fundamental part of the **Linux operating system**. 
- Shells allow you to give commands to the computer and receive responses from it. They can be thought of as a translator between you and your computer system.
- There are many different types of shells, but the **bash shell** is the most commonly used shell in the **cybersecurity profession**.
